# Hackerrank Solutions Archive

This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems from [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  
These files are mainly a backup of the problems I’ve solved and also a simple reference for fellow developers who want clear explanations and working code.

---

## Purpose

- To store and preserve all my solved Hackerrank problems.  
- To provide short explanations along with the solutions. 
- To help others understand classical competitive programming techniques.

---

## What Each File Contains

- Problem credit (link to the official Hackerrank  problem).  
- A simple explanation of the algorithm used.  
- The final working code solution.

Each file is self-contained and easy to read.
